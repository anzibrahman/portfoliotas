                <h4>Shah Rukh Khan</h4>
                <p>Shah Rukh Khan (pronounced [ˈʃɑːɦɾʊx xɑːn] ⓘ; born 2 November 1965), also known by the initialism SRK, is an Indian actor and film producer who works in Hindi films. Referred to in the media as the "Baadshah of Bollywood" and "King Khan",[a] he has appeared in more than 90 films, and earned numerous accolades, including 14 Filmfare Awards. He has been awarded the Padma Shri by the Government of India, as well as the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres and Legion of Honour by the Government of France. Khan has a significant following in Asia and the Indian diaspora worldwide. In terms of audience size and income, several media outlets have described him as one of the most successful film stars in the world.[b] Many of his films thematise Indian national identity and connections with diaspora communities, or gender, racial, social and religious differences and grievances.</p>
                <p>Khan began his career with appearances in several television series in the late 1980s and made his Bollywood debut in 1992 with Deewana. He was initially recognised for playing villainous roles in the films Baazigar (1993) and Darr (1993). Khan established himself by starring in a series of top-grossing romantic films, including Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (1995), Dil To Pagal Hai (1997), Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (1998), Mohabbatein (2000), Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... (2001), Kal Ho Naa Ho (2003), Veer-Zaara (2004) and Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna (2006). He earned critical acclaim for his portrayal of an alcoholic in Devdas (2002), a NASA scientist in Swades (2004), a hockey coach in Chak De! India (2007), and a man with Asperger syndrome in My Name Is Khan (2010).</p>

            <h5>JAWAN</h5>
            <p>According to Shah Rukh Khan, the film's theme is about "women empowerment". Agnivo Niyogi in The Telegraph argues that Jawan pays homage to several SRK films including Phir Bhi Dil Hai Hindustani, Chak De! India, Swades, Chennai Express, and India Today also discusses how Chak De! India influenced Jawan.</p>

            <h5>HAPPY NEW YEAR</h5>

            <h5>Frontend</h5>
            <p>The film begins in the 1960s (evident from a newspaper). Raees, a sharp-minded boy, lives in Fatehpur, Gujarat, a dry state and gets involved in the illegal liquor trade from a young age. He uses his mother's philosophy: no occupation is low and no religion greater than any occupation as a mechanism of self-deception.
